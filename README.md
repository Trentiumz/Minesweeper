# Minesweeper
 A bot for minesweeper

## Home Folder(index.html + index.css + index.js + drawer.js)
A user interface for the minesweeper game - also acts as the "logic recreation tool"

## ai.js
### ml^3 tries minesweeper :D
A script with an AI class. Create an AI object with the correct parameters, and call getMove() on your object to get the move...

# Next Steps
Tune hyperparameters on the spot(for example, I could change # of nodes that are considered at a time based on the total number of nodes we consider)

Take into account the # of bombs - although this seems to only ever work in very rare situations
